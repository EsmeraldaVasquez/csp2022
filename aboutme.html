      <p><b>As I make this website completely from scratch, the date is currently January 14th, 2022. This is a project for computer science class but will be useful for future portfolio needs. It's a great class to learn coding for future engineering jobs. This class has been loads of fun and I'm already looking foward to our next project. I have always been fascinated with the way technology worked. Which is why i'm taking this computer science class and learning how to make this site. However my passion for technology isn't the only thing fueling me today.</b></p>

        <h3>My Story</h3>
      <p>Being the youngest out of five siblings, I often found myself surrounded by many different tastes and hobbies. I am very greatful for my siblings who were always eager to share their intrests. Thanks to them, I was able to find what I enjoyed at an early age.</p>
      <p>I am a very spontaneous person. If I want to learn or do something I will start it on the spot. I honed in on drawing and playing the voilin. If you couldn't tell my love for the arts is massive. Nothing makes me happier than to sit in a quiet room and play/draw for hours on end. The idea of only being able to get better with time gives me comfort. Even when it comes to hobbies I can't help but give it my 100% effort.</p> 
      <p>Although the arts call out to me the most, I also like to stay physically fit as well. During my freetime I like to go out and skateboard or ride my bike. My siblings involve me in their workouts as well, such as hiking or running. The problem with me is that I can never sit still. I'm always on the go and wanting to do new things. I work best when surrounded by people who are as energetic to work and play as I am.</p>
